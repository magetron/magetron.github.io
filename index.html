        <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
        <p class="author">by Robert Frost</p>
        <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
           And sorry I could not travel both<br>
           And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
           And looked down one as far as I could<br>
           To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

        <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
           And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
           Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
           Though as for that the passing there<br>
           Had worn them really about the same,</p>

        <p>And both that morning equally lay<br>
           In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
           Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
           Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
           I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

        <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
           Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
           Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
           I took the one less traveled by,<br>
           And that has made all the difference.</p>
