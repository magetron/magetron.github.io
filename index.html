    <h1>Do not go gentle into that good night</h1>
    <p class="author">by Dylan Thomas</p>
    <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
      Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
      Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

    <p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
      Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
      Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

    <p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
      Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
      Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

    <p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
      And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
      Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

    <p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
      Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
      Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

    <p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
      Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
      Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
      Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
